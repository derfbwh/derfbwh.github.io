Weather forecast for tonight: dark.
The sun is a deadly laser.
I like my weather like I like my coffee: hot and existing.
Humidity is just the air giving you a wet hug.
Why did the cloud break up with the fog? He was too down to earth.
It's so hot, the squirrels are fanning their nuts.
The wind is just the sky showing off its dance moves.
Rain is just confetti from the sky.
It's not the heat, it's the stupidity.
I tried to catch some fog, but I mist.
My favorite weather is bird-chirping weather.
The sky is just a big, blue mood ring.
