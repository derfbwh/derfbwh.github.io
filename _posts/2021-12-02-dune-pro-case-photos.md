Today, after two long years of waiting, I received my Dune Pro case. I'm planning on doing a more extensive first impressions post shortly, but here's some quick photos I just snapped to tide you over. 

Short tl;dr though - it feels great, and it looks great. Its not perfect, though - there are some rough edges on the Dice Y front panel, and the gaps between panels are large. 

Alex and Dune, if you're reading, ship the rest of the cases. You shouldn't have to be a "Lucky 10" winner like I was to receive what you paid for. Its been 2 years. Enough games. Enough excuses. Get it done.
