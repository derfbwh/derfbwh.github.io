title: iPhone 6 Plus is no iPad nano
---

Lots are comparing the iPhone 6 Plus to the iPad lineup, and I really haven't thought that's fair. [Jason Snell](http://sixcolors.com/post/2014/09/iphone-6-plus-its-not-an-ipad-nano.html), who has actually been reviewing and using both new iPhones since last week, apparently feels the same way.

> I’m not saying the iPhone 6 Plus is wrong for not being an iPad. Not at all. What I’m saying is, it’s not an iPad—and that I think people who expect it to be one are going to be disappointed. If the question is, “Big iPhone or small iPad?”, the answer is clear: The iPhone 6 Plus is called iPhone for a reason, and it’s not the Phone app. Choose your preferred iPhone model with that in mind.

Can't wait to get mine.
