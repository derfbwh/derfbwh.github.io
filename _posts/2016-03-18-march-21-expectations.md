I've published my annual list of what to reasonably expect at this Monday's Apple Media Event [over at Haverzine](http://haverzine.com/2016/03/18/what-to-realistically-expect-at-apples-iphone-se-ipad-pro-event/). 

> Apple is a company of cycles. Traditionally, Apple has been bound to the calendar like Christmas to December; WWDC in June, new iPhones in September, and new iPads in October.
> 
> But Tim Cook’s Apple has been considerably more open to switching things up, forgoing expected events or making announcements at unexpected times. Today we find ourselves on the verge of one such aberrations with the announcement of Apple’s “Let Us Loop you In” Media Event scheduled for next Monday, March 21.
