title: PSA - Avoid updating to iOS 8.0.1
---

Me, myself, and I on [Haverzine](http://haverzine.com/2014/09/24/psa-update-idevice-ios-8-0-1/):

> Well, this isn't good. Hopefully you caught our update to today's iOS 8.0.1 announcement post, but if you haven't, we'll say it again now to save you and your precious iDevice any pain and suffering. Reports are flooding in that iOS 8.0.1 basically destroys your iPhone, completely breaking cellular connectivity as well as Touc h ID on compatible devices.

How Apple let something like this get released is beyond me. Where's the quality control? Beta testing? Just embarrassing.
