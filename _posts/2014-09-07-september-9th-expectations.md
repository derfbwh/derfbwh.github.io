title: What to realistically expect at Apple's September 9th special event
---

Yours truly, [over at Haverzine](http://haverzine.com/2014/09/08/realistically-expect-apples-september-6th-2014-special-event/ "Haverzine").

> It’s almost here. Tomorrow, Apple is holding its first big special event of the year (excluding WWDC) – and we’re expecting it to be quite the doozy. Apple is certainly going to be using the event to launch its upcoming iPhone lineup, but what else could be in the pipeline? Last year around this time Apple announced not one, but two new iPhones alongside the announcement of the final build of iOS 7, and we’re expecting an equally – if not more – impressive showing this time around. So without further ado, this is what you can realistically expect at Apple’s special event tomorrow. No bullshit, just the good stuff.

In the future I'll have a lot of unique content hitting this space, but given tomorrow's event I thought it was important to start off with a link to this.
