title: What to (mostly) realistically expect at Apple's March 9th event
---

I make some bold predictions [over at Haverzine](http://haverzine.com/2015/03/08/mostly-realistically-expect-mondays-apple-watch-event/ "Haverzine").

> This year had to be different. When Apple announced the Apple Watch at last September’s media event, it was also announcing its first new product category since the iPad in 2010. It was announcing a product unlike one ever to come out of Apple; intimately customizable, from watch face to watch band to watch price. Are you in the market for the potentially five figure Apple Watch Edition, by any chance?
>
> The Apple Watch makes predicting Monday’s event impossible. Traditionally, anybody who knew how to read Apple’s product release cycle and what type of product they traditionally released could make fairly accurate predictions on what to expect – it’s why we’ve been correct in all but one of our nearly twenty predictions thus far. This time, the only thing we can know for sure is that the Apple Watch is coming. Everything else?

This was a doozy, and probably the most difficult "What to realistically expect" post in the series. But I feel good about most of those predictions.
